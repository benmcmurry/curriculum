    Guiding Principles for ELC Curriculum
</div>

<div class="container-md pt-4">
    
    <p>The following represent our values and beliefs regarding language teaching, learning and curriculum development.
        Our curricular philosophy is divided into four sections dealing with <a
        href='#curriculum'>curricular development and curricular change</a>, <a href='#ppp'>pedagogical practice</a>, <a
            href='#skill_area'>teaching specific language skills</a>, and <a href="#students">student learning</a>.

        <h2>Curriculum Development and Curricular Change</h2></a>


        <p>We define curriculum as: all of our school-sponsored activities along with the associated materials,
            resources, and facilities needed to maximize meaningful student participation. This encompasses what the
            students are to learn and how they are to learn it, including how the teachers and the institution
            facilitate, assess, and respond to this learning (adapted from Rogers, 1989, p. 26).</p>
        <img style='float:right' src='images/triangle.png' />
        <p>All efforts associated with curriculum development and change seek an appropriate balance between three
            interrelated principles to ensure the curriculum is stable, responsive, and cohesive (see Figure 1). </p>
        <p>Though all effective curricula must embrace some innovation, a stable curriculum implements change in a way
            that is orderly, systematic, and principled. For a curriculum to change in this manner and to remain viable,
            it must also be responsive to such factors as student needs, institutional and environmental changes, and
            current research. Without responsiveness, a stable curriculum soon stagnates. Finally, a sound curriculum is
            cohesive in that there is internal consistency and continuity between and across the various elements of the
            curriculum.</p>

        <h2>Pedagogical Practice</h2>
    </a>


    <p>ELC teachers strive to exemplify the following pedagogical practices for themselves, their students, and all who
        may observe their classes.</p>
    <h3>1. Rely on course outcomes</h3>
    <p>
        Teachers understand the course outcomes for the skill and proficiency
        level in which they teach and effectively communicate
        them to students. They can describe student behaviors that
        demonstrate these outcomes, and they successfully design classroom-learning
        activities that help students progress toward
        achieving them. Teachers engage in ongoing informal and formal
        assessment activities and provide personalized feedback
        based on the course outcomes.</p>
    <h3>2. Plan lessons effectively</h3>
    <p>
        Teachers carefully plan lessons so language development will
        be optimized during the class period. Teachers plan to incorporate
        an appropriate number and variety of learning activities that
        are meaningful and engaging. These activities build incrementally
        from more simple uses of language to more complex uses
        that are authentic and communicative. Teachers consider the
        best ways to ensure that communication of explanations and
        expectations are clear and concise in order to maximize student
        language practice. This includes preparing the board or other
        materials well ahead of class time. Teachers also prepare contingency
        plans in order to adjust for a variety of unforeseen circumstances
        and changing student needs.</p>
    <h3>3. Optimize class time</h3>
    <p>
        Teachers feel a sense of urgency about using as much of the
        classroom time as possible for meaningful language practice.
        They convey this sense of urgency to their students by starting
        class on time and by carefully managing activities and transitions
        in order to maximize communicative language practice.
        However, rather than rushing through their lessons, teachers
        skillfully connect activities and ensure that students achieve the
        needed level of mastery before moving on. They anticipate potential
        threats to effective use of class time such as problems
        with technology, excessive student questions, inappropriate student
        behaviors and so on. Their responses to such challenges are
        principled and appropriately bring the class back on course.
        Teachers also end class on time.</p>
    <h3>4. Cultivate a positive learning environment</h3>
    <p>
        Teachers understand the necessity of a positive learning environment
        in order to optimize learning. They recognize that positive
        teacher-student interaction is at the heart of the environment
        they seek to cultivate. They foster genuine concern for their
        students and their learning based on principles of respect and
        trust. They leave personal concerns behind as they plan and
        teach their classes. They are consistent and equitable in their
        classroom practices and help students to see how classroom
        policies and activities facilitate language development. They
        create a non-threatening learning environment that is cheerful,
        upbeat, and optimistic. They inspire students to do their best,
        and they help them experience the joy of effectively applying
        what they learn. They sincerely praise students and regularly
        express confidence in their abilities.</p>
    <h3>5. Evaluate learning effectively</h3>
    <p>
        Teachers are committed to the ongoing evaluation of student
        learning. They skillfully use diagnostic tests, classroom instruction,
        language practice, and formal and informal assessments to
        clarify individual learner needs in relation to established course
        outcomes. They also regularly solicit qualitative input from their
        students regarding learning materials and methods. This information
        is then used to make appropriate adjustments in lesson
        planning and the selection of materials and methods used in the
        classroom. Teachers help students to understand the rationale
        for adjustments that are made as well as areas where continuity
        may be necessary.</p>
    <h3>6. Utilize homework strategically</h3>
    <p>
        Teachers understand the potential for effective homework to
        help students achieve course outcomes. Rather than assigning
        busy work, they carefully consider the quantity and specific
        kinds of learning activities that are needed by their students in
        order to foster language development or to help them better understand
        and diagnose learner needs. They are able to effectively
        communicate the rationale for various types of homework to
        their students. They demonstrate the value of the homework in
        the way they follow up and process the homework. They know
        when it may be appropriate to review certain types of homework
        in class and when the class time should be used for other activities.
        They utilize student performance on homework to inform
        their ongoing instruction in the classroom.</p>
    <h3>7. Provide meaningful and timely feedback</h3>
    <p>
        Teachers know that feedback is essential to effective learning.
        They regularly provide students with feedback that is meaningful—it
        focuses on the most important language elements for
        each learner; students understand the feedback, why it was given,
        and how to apply it. Though teachers ensure that ongoing
        feedback is timely, they are careful not to overload the students’
        cognitive ability to process and apply the feedback. Along with
        feedback, teachers provide students with abundant opportunities
        to practice and apply the feedback in a variety of learning contexts.</p>
    <h3>8. Exemplify professionalism</h3>
    <p>
        Teachers value and participate in orientations, training, and
        workshops. They are well prepared, punctual, and complete all
        administrative tasks on time. They act and look the part of a
        professional in the classroom including adhering to the dress
        and grooming standards and maintaining appropriate teacherstudent
        boundaries. They are respectful and courteous with their
        students and other teachers with whom they share resources
        such as classrooms, offices, technologies, and learning materials.
        They consistently evaluate their own teaching and seek to
        improve through feedback from students, administrators, and
        peers. They appropriately apply the relevant feedback they receive.</p>

        echo "<p>".$skillAreas['skill_area_philosophy']."</p>";
    }
        
    ?>
    <a id='students'>
        <h2>Student Learning</h2>
    </a>
    <p>We believe that student learning is optimized when students are:</p>
    <h3><strong>A</strong>ware</h3>
    <p>Students know why they are studying English at the ELC. They set specific goals for their English development and
        prioritize their time commitments. They choose to learn the policies of the ELC and follow them, resulting in a
        more pleasant and productive experience. They understand their course outcomes and know what assignments are due
        in each class and when. They identify what they need to do in order to improve their English language skills.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>R</strong>eady to Learn</h3>
    <p>Students establish beneficial patterns in their lives such as a healthy diet, getting enough water, exercise, and
        sleep, so they can be alert and optimize their learning. Students seek a positive and optimistic outlook and are
        patient with themselves and others. They also seek help when they experience mental or emotional difficulties.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>I</strong>nvested</h3>
    <p>Students work hard every day to improve their English. They complete their homework on time and strive to master
        the principles behind the homework. They are disciplined, focused, and persistent in their English study and
        practice. They fully participate in class. They also seek opportunities to use English whenever possible outside
        of class.</p>

    <h3><strong>S</strong>trategic</h3>
    <p>Students learn about a wide variety of strategies for learning and using English effectively. They determine
        which strategies may work best for them in specific contexts. They identify and successfully implement those
        strategies that best facilitate their English language learning and use. </p>

    <h3><strong>E</strong>valuative</h3>
    <p>Students regularly evaluate their English language learning. They are reflective and perceptive about their
        progress. They understand their own strengths and weaknesses and how to access resources that may help them.
        They also identify challenges and make appropriate changes in their attitudes, behaviors, routines, or
        approaches to learning. They continually seek for and apply feedback they receive.</p>
